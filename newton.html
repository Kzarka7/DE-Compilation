		<p> This website allows users to solve problems associated with Newton's Law of Cooling / Heating, which is useful in various scientific and engineering contexts. </p>
		<p> Selecting the missing variables on the left side by opening the sidebar, it will ask specific variables and inputs to the user and calculate the chosen missing variable except for C and K. </p>
