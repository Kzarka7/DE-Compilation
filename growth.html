		<p> This website is designed to calculate values associated with population growth and decay, commonly used in fields such as biology, ecology, and economics.</p>
		<p> It has the same concept as the other tab but different variables and formulas. Only single missing variables except for C and K can be calculated, one at a time.</p>
